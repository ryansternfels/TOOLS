# TOOLS
A collection of simple scripts I'll be publishing during my cybersecurity learning journey.

I'm new to the community and welcome supportive, encouraging, constructive criticism about my work.

I'm mostly here to learn, while also utilizing this space to showcase my work and progress.

I welcome collaboration! Feel free to do whatever you'd like with this simple script :)

Thanks for reading!
